    <dt>Where?</dt>
    <dd><p>Mote Marine Laboratory &amp; Aquarium<br>
    1600 Ken Thompson Parkway<br>
    Sarasota, FL 34236<br>
    941-388-4441<br>
    www.mote.org<br></p>

    <p>The wedding will be held at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota,
    Florida.  Visit their website <a href="http://mote.org/">here</a>.  The
    ceremony and reception will both take place in the New Pass Room of the
    Keating Marine Education Center.  We hope to see you there!  Maps and
    directions to the venue and other event locations will be made available
    here in the coming months.</p>

    <p>From Sarasota: Getting to Mote Marine is easy!  The lab is located on
    City Island, over the Ringling Bridge and past St. Armand's Circle.
    Click
    <a href="http://mote.org/index.php?submenu=AQUARIUM&src=gendocs&ref=Aquarium%20-%20Detailed%20Directions&category=Aquarium">here</a>
    for directions.  Once you're over the bridge, just follow the signs.</p>

    <p>From the southeastern US:  Sarasota is located one hour south of Tampa
    on I-75.  Driving here is fairly straightforward.  Contact us if you need
    addresses to use in your GPS/map search engine of choice.  See the link
    above for driving directions to the lab.</p>

    <p>From the everywhere else:  We recommend flying into Tampa International
    Airport (TPA) for the best rates.  A closer but sometimes more expensive
    airport is the Sarasota-Bradenton International Airport (SRQ).  If you plan to
    do a lot of sight-seeing while you're here, renting a car is probably your best
    choice once here.  However, a free trolley service runs up and down the
    coastline, so if you stay by the beach, you probably don't need a car.  More
    information on accommodations will be made available soon.</p></dd>

    your questions, and we'll try to answer them!  Thanks!</p></dd>
