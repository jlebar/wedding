    and directions to other event locations will be made available here in the
    coming months.</p>

    <p>From Sarasota: The lab is located on City Island, over the Ringling
    Bridge and past St. Armand's Circle.  Click <a
    href="http://mote.org/index.php?submenu=AQUARIUM&src=gendocs&ref=Aquarium%20-%20Detailed%20Directions&category=Aquarium">here</a>
